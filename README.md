To run the build, just enter the "Build" folder and run the executable.

If you would like to check the source code, you can find it on the DC_Unity/Assets/Resources path. The "Scripts" folder contains all the scripts arranged in multiple folders.
Some scripts which might be of interest are the ones in the GameManagement folder, notably AIManagement, AResources and GameManagement.
